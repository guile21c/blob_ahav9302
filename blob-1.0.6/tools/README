README for the "tools" directory

This directory is for holding the generated GNU autoconf/automake/libtool
scripts. In order to generate those scripts in this directory, the file
"configure.in" should contain the following line:

AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR(tools)

It also contains the "rebuild" and "rebuild-gcc" scripts which
automatically update configure, config.h.in and automatically update all
Makefile.in files. The rebuild script is for use with non-GNU compilers,
The rebuild-gcc script for GNU C/C++ compilers.
